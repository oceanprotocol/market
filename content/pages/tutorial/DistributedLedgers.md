title: Distributed ledgers
chapter: 1

Understanding the concept of a distributed ledger and smart contracts is essential to fully grasp the value that Gaia-X powered by Ocean Protocol can provide. If you are already familiar with these concepts, you can go directly to chapter 2.

**A Blockchain**

is simply a distributed ledger that chronologically records the facts that it is programmed to record. This ledger is duplicated across participants, and public, which allows everyone to check that its entries are correct. This removes the need for a central &#39;validation authority&#39;: you don&#39;t need to trust when you can verify.

**Blockchains have some amazing properties:**

- Only those with a valid input can change the state
- Old entries cannot be altered or deleted
- Everyone can see that no one provided a non-compliant input

**Ethereum** was the first ledger to allow the recording of not just transactions, but any kind of operation, making it essentially a distributed computer. This greatly extends the foundation of traditional blockchains to all sorts of applications.

The Ethereum blockchains is permissionless: anyone can operate or transact on these blockchains. Private blockchains exist, but they are limited in scope. And they wouldn&#39;t be well suited to create an inclusive data economy: **Gaia-X powered by\*\*** Ocean Protocol\*\* wants to be accessible to anyone who has data or expertise, not just a select few.
