The Web3 is a mesh network of blockchains and smart contracts that interact with each other, and that form a new layer on top of the current internet. Web3 has no central point, no owners, and no borders.

It&#39;s called Web 3.0 because it&#39;s an evolution of the internet since its beginning. The Web3 internet is built on a fundamentally different infrastructure, utilizing blockchains and distributed peer-to-peer networks, compared to the current existing internet which relies on server-client relationships.

Web3 enables full liberalization of networks, removing the need for central intermediaries. Just like TCP/IP are communication protocols that define how information is sent between clients and servers over the web, Ocean Protocol is a protocol that defines how data assets are exchanged in Web3.

**A decentralized computer**. We mentioned earlier that Ethereum adds the capability to execute programs on its blockchain. This effectively makes it a cloud computer that is owned by none and maintained by an open-source community. Everyone can deploy a program and everyone can execute it according to its rules: an independent piece of software code. This is called a smart contract.
But we should not assume that this computer is efficient enough to do actual calculations. The execution speed is relatively slow and expensive. This new computer does not replace cloud computers but enables a new infrastructure to utilize our resources in new ways. It fosters novel approaches to dealing with data, computation, business operation and promotes a new data economy.
