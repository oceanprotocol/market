**Using our market functionalities**

If you use our market functionalities, we disclose your wallet address and author name (if applicable) by transmitting it to a smart contract.

# 5. Cookies and web storage

A cookie is a small file that stores Internet settings. Your web browser downloads it on the first visit to a website. The next time you open this website with the same device, the cookie and the information stored in it are either sent back to the website that created it (first-party cookie) or sent to another website it belongs to (third-party cookie). This enables the website to detect that you have opened it previously with this browser and, in some cases, to vary the displayed content.

Our market does not use cookies for analytics or marketing purposes. Instead, we use a functional first-party cookie that does not transmit personal data about you. This cookie is used to enhance your user experience and will be removed once you close your browser.

Our market also uses local storage and session storage, which have similar functionality to cookies. We use your web storage to remember your page preferences and to enhance your user experience. We also do not store personal data in the local storage and session storage. Your browser will remove the session storage once you close your browser.
